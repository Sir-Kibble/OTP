# OTP
A java implementation of the One Time Pad algorithm with a GUI.  
This program should only be used for educational purposes and is 
NOT recommended to be used in-lieu of other forms of encryption/encypherment.

Download the otp_encoder.jar and latest java runtimes to use.

I made this program to help teach a Cyberpatriot lesson.  Please feel
free to contribute and add/improve features and usability!  Or not.  S'all good in the hood.
