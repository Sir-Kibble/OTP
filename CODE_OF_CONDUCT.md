# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

This will not be a professional product, thus this will not be a professional Code of Conduct.  

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to not be asswads.  We also pledge not to take things too seriously, as this is the internet.  By agreeing to this code of conduct, you pledge to not get your 
panties in a bunch over dumb things.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accepting constructive criticism
* Not being a dick

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Being a dick

##In General...

This project is a freespeech zone, since sadly this is a needed thing.  The only content that will be deleted
is valueless spam and content that has nothing to do with the project AND is not funny.  JOKE POLICE GET OUT! REEE!!!

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and judging the hilarity of innapropriate behavior.  If you're going to fuck up, make it funny.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions for any reason they feel like because reasons.  Don't be an asswad and we'll get along fine.

## Scope

This document applies in a non-legally binding manner to this little corner of the internet and all of the dank may mays contained within.  

## Enforcement

We'll enforce the terms laid out if we feel like it, probably.  Refer to not taking things too seriously.
